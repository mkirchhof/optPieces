This folder includes settings of the tool aswell as the translations into other languages.

Please do not edit the settings files as they are generated and maintained automatically by the tool. They correspond to the actions the user made the last time he used the tool. If you delete those files, the tool will automatically generate new ones.

You can feel free to add new languages into the languages.csv file as new columns. They will be available automatically in the tool. Please verify that you use a .csv file (sep = ",", dec = ".") with UTF-8 encoding. As column names, use the language's name in its own language.
